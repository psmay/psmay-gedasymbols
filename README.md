# psmay : gEDA Symbols

## Synopsis

These are materials created for use with [gEDA]. The directory structure is
consistent with a user directory on [gedasymbols.org] in the event that at any
point I ask for and am granted a CVS account there. (Somehow, apparently people
are still using CVS.) I prefer bzr and am tolerant of git, so I'll be
maintaining my gEDA stuff elsewhere for the time being.
