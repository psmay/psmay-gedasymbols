# psmay : gEDA Symbols

## Synopsis

These are materials created for use with [gEDA]. The directory structure is
consistent with a user directory on [gedasymbols.org] in the event that at any
point I ask for and am granted a CVS account there. (Somehow, apparently people
are still using CVS.) I prefer bzr and am tolerant of git, so I'll be
maintaining my gEDA stuff elsewhere for the time being.

  [gedasymbols.org]: http://www.gedasymbols.org/

## Usage

These instructions assume a working copy of this branch is at

	/some-path/psmay-gedasymbols

Substitute the actual location as necessary. Absolute paths should be used
unless the usage is project-specific.

### gschem

To `~/.gEDA/gafrc`, add:

	(component-library "/some-path/psmay-gedasymbols/symbols")

### pcb

In preferences, under Library, add

	/some-path/psmay-gedasymbols/footprints

to the Element Directories. This is a `:`-delimited list, so add a delimiter if
necessary.

(This is also the `library-newlib` setting in `~/.pcb/preferences`.)

### gsch2pcb

Footprints are only mapped from the `footprint` attributes in a schematic if
the `elements-dir` has been added to the project.

To the project `.gsch2pcb` file, add:

	elements-dir /some-path/psmay-gedasymbols/footprints
